# Multi-facet user preference learning for fine-grained item recommendation

Existing works consider user preference in item level, then whether behaviour level is important in learning user preference? Here we consider multiple facets of user preference: group-facet, individual-facet (item level), action-facet (behaviour level). This is our official implementation for the paper:
